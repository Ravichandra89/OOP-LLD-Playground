ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy: Group Chat
Mediator: The ChatRoom acts as a central hub that coordinates communication.

Colleagues: Each User represents a participant in the group chat.

Instead of users sending messages directly to each other, they send messages to the ChatRoom, which forwards it to other users. which implement the loose coupling between the colleagues.
